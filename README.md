## Brain games project
"Brain Games" - a set of five console games, built on the principle of popular mobile applications for brain pumping. Each game asks questions to which you have to give correct answers. After three correct answers, the game is considered to be completed. Incorrect answers end the game and prompt you to go through it again. Games:
- Calculator. Arithmetic expressions to be calculated;
- Determining an even number;
- Determining the greatest common divisor;
- Progression. Finding missing numbers in a sequence of numbers;
- Determining a prime number;

## System requirements:
- node.js 13+

## Game №1 "Even number"
Game rules: the user is shown a random number. The user has to answer 'yes' if the number is even or 'no' if it is odd.

Print in terminal 'brain-even' for start playing.

## Game №2 "Calculator"
Game rules: the user is shown a random mathematical expression, such as 35 + 16, to calculate and record the correct answer.

Print in terminal 'brain-calc' for start playing.

## Game №3 "Greatest common divisor"
Game rules: the user is shown two random numbers, e.g. 25, 50. The user must calculate and enter the greatest common divisor of these numbers.

Print in terminal 'brain-gcd' for start playing.

##  Game №4 "Progression"
Game rules: show the player a series of numbers that form an arithmetic progression, replacing any of the numbers with two dots. The player must identify this number.
- The recommended length of the progression is 10 numbers. The length can be randomly generated, but must contain at least 5 numbers;
- The position of the hidden element changes each time (randomly selected).

Print in terminal 'brain-progression' for start playing.

## Game №5 "Prime number"
Game rules: show the player a series of numbers, you need to determine whether the number is prime or not. If the number is prime, the player writes yes, if not, he writes no.

Print in terminal 'brain-prime' for start playing.
