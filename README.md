## Brain games project
"Brain Games" - a set of five console games, built on the principle of popular mobile applications for brain pumping. Each game asks questions to which you have to give correct answers.

- Calculator. Arithmetic expressions to be calculated;
- Determining an even number;
- Determining the greatest common divisor;
- Progression. Finding missing numbers in a sequence of numbers;
- Determining a prime number;

## System requirements:
